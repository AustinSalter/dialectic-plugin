# N-Pass Strategic Reasoning

Iterative reasoning architecture that separates divergent exploration from convergent synthesis.

## Architecture Overview

```

│  EXPANSION  │────▶│ COMPRESSION │────▶│   CRITIQUE  │
│  (diverge)  │     │  (converge) │     │  (decide)   │

                              │ DISTILLATION │

                              iterates until

```

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/dialectic:dialectic` | Run the reasoning loop (expansion → compression → critique) |
| `/dialectic:dialectic-distill` | Distill reasoning artifacts into conviction memo |
| `/dialectic:cancel-dialectic` | Cancel active session and preserve artifacts |

## Pass Selection

| Pass | When to Use | Output |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **Expansion** | Starting analysis or exploring new threads | Marked reasoning with `[INSIGHT]`, `[EVIDENCE]`, etc. |
| **Compression** | After expansion, to synthesize findings | Structured state (insights, tensions, threads, confidence) |
| **Critique** | After compression, to decide next action | Decision (CONTINUE/CONCLUDE/PIVOT) with reasoning |
| **Synthesis** | When concluding, to produce final output | Final thesis with confidence and key evidence |
| **Escape Hatch** | Max iterations reached with low confidence | Honest assessment of blockers and limitations |

## Working Memory Format

Passes receive working memory as context. Standard format:

```
## Working Memory (After Cycle N)

### Validated Insights
1. [claim] — Confidence: 0.XX

### Unresolved Tensions
- [description of conflicting evidence]

### Threads to Explore
- [topic]: [why it matters]

### Overall Confidence: 0.XX
```

## Pass Instructions

**Expansion**: See [EXPANSION.md](EXPANSION.md)
**Compression**: See [COMPRESSION.md](COMPRESSION.md)
**Critique**: See [CRITIQUE.md](CRITIQUE.md) — includes 6 questioning techniques, problem-type routing, 3D confidence
**Synthesis**: See [SYNTHESIS.md](SYNTHESIS.md)
**Escape Hatch**: See [ESCAPE-HATCH.md](ESCAPE-HATCH.md)

## Semantic Markers

All passes use consistent semantic markers. See [MARKERS.md](MARKERS.md) for definitions and usage.

## 3D Confidence Model

Single scalar confidence conflates reasoning quality, evidence quality, and conclusion certainty. Use three independent dimensions:

- **R (Reasoning)**: Is the logic sound? (0.0-1.0)
- **E (Evidence)**: Is evidence complete? (0.0-1.0)
- **C (Conclusion)**: How certain given R and E? (0.0-1.0)

**Composite**: `(R + E + C) / 3` — NOT multiplicative.

See [COMPRESSION.md](COMPRESSION.md) and [CRITIQUE.md](CRITIQUE.md) for details.

## Termination Conditions

Analysis terminates when any of:
1. **Conclusion**: Critique decides thesis is robust (CONCLUDE)
2. **Saturation**: Confidence delta < 0.05 for 2 consecutive cycles
3. **High confidence**: Score ≥ 0.75 with < 2 unresolved questions
4. **Max cycles**: Hard limit reached (triggers escape hatch if confidence < 0.5)

## Quick Start

For a new strategic question:

1. Run **Expansion** pass with the question and empty working memory
2. Run **Compression** pass on the expansion output
3. Run **Critique** pass to decide: CONTINUE, CONCLUDE, or PIVOT
4. If CONTINUE: loop back to step 1 with updated working memory
5. If CONCLUDE: run **Synthesis** pass
6. If PIVOT: revise thesis and loop back to step 1
